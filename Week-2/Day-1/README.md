# Week 2 • Day 1 • JavaScript ES6 Practice

## 🧩 Overview
This set of tasks focuses on practicing modern JavaScript (ES6) concepts such as destructuring, spread/rest operators, template literals, and refactoring older JS code.

---

## 📝 Task 1: Array/Object Destructuring
### 🎯 Goal
Extract specific values from objects or arrays using ES6 destructuring.

### ✔️ What Was Done
- Extracted `brand` and `model` from the `car` object.  
- Logged the extracted values to the console.

---

## 📝 Task 2: Spread and Rest Operator Practice
### 🎯 Goal
Learn how to merge arrays and handle multiple arguments using ES6 features.

### ✔️ What Was Done
- Merged `fruits` and `moreFruits` arrays using the **spread operator**.  
- Created a function using the **rest operator** that accepts any number of fruits and logs them.

---

## 📝 Task 3: Template Literals
### 🎯 Goal
Use template literals to create cleaner and more readable strings.

### ✔️ What Was Done
- Displayed the message:  
  **"Hello Priya! Welcome to JavaScript Mastery."**  
  using backticks and `${variable}` syntax.

---

## 📝 Task 4: Code Refactor (ES5 → ES6)
### 🎯 Goal
Rewrite old JavaScript code using modern ES6 syntax.

### ✔️ What Was Done
- Replaced `var` with `const`.  
- Rewrote the `greet` function using an **arrow function**.  
- Used **template literals** for cleaner string formatting.

## 💡 Concepts Practiced
- Object & Array Destructuring  
- Spread (`...`) and Rest (`...`) operators  
- Template Literals  
- Arrow Functions  
- Cleaner and modern ES6 syntax
